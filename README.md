# Recipes

My set of recipes. I started with pizza but then eventually I will put all of them.

I am collecting them here mostly to share them with friends and family.

Mind that I am not a cook, so I am sure that there are many unprofessional things I do in every recipe. I am open to suggestions, just [create an issue](https://github.com/micdonato/pizza/issues) and we can chat about it (same for questions about a particular recipe).

## Website or no website

If GitHub scares you you can try the [mirror website](https://micdonato.github.io/pizza/). It is always going to have the same content, so it is up to you what you want to bookmark.
However, if you have a GitHub account you can "watch" this repository so you can be notified when I add new recipes.

## Vegetarians and vegans

Most of the recipes right now are vegan (in their default version). The addition of cheese is usually done at the end so one can skip that.  
In some cases I will suggest some optional changes that might please meat lovers.

## The actual recipes

* [Pizza](docs/bestpizza.md)
* [Broccoli rabe orecchiette (or any pasta really)](docs/rabepasta.md) 
* [Pasta almost alla Norma](docs/pastanorma.md)
* [Impossible ragu](docs/impossibleragu.md)
* [Chickpea stew](docs/pastaececi.md)

## How it is organized

I am going to put all the markdown documentation in the `docs` folder for now.
