# Recipes

My set of recipes. I started with pizza but then eventually I will put all of them.

I am collecting them here mostly to share them with friends and family.

## The actual recipe(s)

* [Pizza](docs/bestpizza.md)
* [Broccoli rabe orecchiette (or any pasta really)](docs/rabepasta.md)

## How it is organized

I am going to put all the markdown documentation in the `docs` folder for now.
