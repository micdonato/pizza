# Recipes

My set of recipes. I started with pizza but then eventually I will put all of them.

I am collecting them here mostly to share them with friends and family.

Mind that I am not a cook, so I am sure that there are many unprofessional things I do in every recipe. I am open to suggestions, just [create an issue](https://github.com/micdonato/pizza/issues) and we can chat about it (same for questions about a particular recipe).

## The actual recipe(s)

* [Pizza](docs/bestpizza.md)
* [Broccoli rabe orecchiette (or any pasta really)](docs/rabepasta.md)
* [Pasta almost alla Norma](docs/pastanorma.md)
* [Impossible ragu](docs/impossibleragu.md)

## How it is organized

I am going to put all the markdown documentation in the `docs` folder for now.
