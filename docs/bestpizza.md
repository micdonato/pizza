# Pizza

## Ingredients

Refer to this picture for list of ingredients except for the yeast: this original recipe calls for 24hrs rise, but here I do about 3 total. Therefore I use 3.5 grams (half a packet) if I do less than 4 pizzas, and 7 grams if I do 4 to 6 pizzas.

This is the flour I use, but I tried:

* all purpose
* regular bread flour
* a 70/30 mix of bread flour and whole wheat bread flour (add 5% more water)

My conclusions are that 00 flour is the best but all the others kind of work too

## Items needed

* Bowls, so many bowls, of all sizes
* Pizza stone for best results, but an upside down metal pan works too (not as well, but still, pizza)
* A kitchen scale.
* A bunch of kitchen towels
* A large pan, as large as you want your pizza to be
* Best if you have a pizza peel and an infrared thermometer.

## Protocol

1. If you use dry yeast, this is the time to put it in 1/8 cup of water, half a teaspoon of sugar, and put it in the oven with the light on (or in any place where it can happily stay at 30C)
2. Put the salt in 1/8 or 1/4 cup of water, and stir well. DO NOT ADD THIS TO THE DOUGH YET. Every time I added it to the dough I had issues with rising.
3. Once the yeast starts bubbling, knead all the flour, water, and yeast. How long? If you have a standing mixer, 5 minutes will be enough. If you do that by hand, it will be more like 10 minutes.
4. Put the dough to rest, in a covered and lightly floured bowl, in the oven with the light on (or the same 30C place where you put the yeast - henceforth referred to as “The 30C Place”) for 30 minutes. I do that because every time I mix salt and yeast together, the yeast dies and my dough doesn’t rise.
5. Mix the salt water (brine?) with the dough. It will be a mess at first. Have faith and do not add any flour here. Just keep mixing. If you do not have a standing mixer you probably should do this inside a large bowl.
6. As in 5, do not lose faith in the ingredients’ proportions. Keep kneading until your dough passes the [windowpane test](https://www.thekitchn.com/bakers-techniques-how-to-do-th-70784). Let it rest (still in the bowl) for 20 minutes in The 30C Place (T30CP, cannot write that every time).
7. Now we move to the “areation” phase of the dough. Put some flour on a flat surface, put the dough on it, and poke it with your fingers until is kind of flat. It does not need to be stretched. Then fold the dough on itself once, poke with fingers, fold again, poke with fingers, fold again and make a ball of it. Summarizing: poke, fold, poke, fold, poke, fold, ball it.This process incorporates a lot of air in the dough so that it fluffs up.
8. Put back in T30CP for 10 minutes (still in a bowl). I think I got this from the book of a famous San Francisco Bakery whose name starts with T and it rhymes with thirtheen.
9. Poke, fold, poke, fold, poke, fold, ball. Back in T30CP for 5 minutes.
10. Poke, fold, poke, fold, poke, fold, ball.
11. Now it’s time to let the dough rest for the first hour in T30CP, in a bowl, if that wasn’t clear.
12. After the hour(-ish) is past, take the dough out and start making the balls. You will need to put the balls in some sort of ROUND container. It needs to be round otherwise you won’t get a round pizza. If you want to do a pan pizza in a square pan, use a square container. For a pizza I usually do 220g, for a focaccia I do 280g to 300g as I like it a bit thicker.
13. Some people put flour in the balls’ containers. I like to do spray oil, just do not overspray.
14. The technique for making the balls is also called [“pirlatura”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4GgWcMNufM&themeRefresh=1). This guy actually makes another round of folding. I don’t think that’s needed, and I never do it. The main point is to stretch the top of the ball towards the bottom, without breaking the surface. When you feel tension on the surface, that’s the time to stop.
15. The balls need to rest in T30CP until they rise again. Usually it takes mine 1.5 hours.
16. If you use the “combo method” take the balls out of the oven, put the containers on a non-stone surface (cutting board or a few kitchen towels to insulate the container from a cold stone), cover them with kitchen towels or even a bathroom towel (clean please) and heat up the oven, with the stone in, at 420F. Important: the stone needs to be as close to the heating element as possible. Use the highest rack in your oven (as long as there is space for the pizza)
17. When your oven is at 420F, put it to Broil HIGH and  heat up the big pan. If you have an infrared thermometer, the sweet spot is 260C (sorry for the C/F mix). Otherwise keep it at medium heat.
18. Stretch your balls on a surface with a decent amount of flour
19. Put the stretched pie in the pan. I usually poke it with my fingers a bit more in the first 30 seconds or so, it helps stretch it a bit more.
20. PIZZA: Put your condiments on the pizza. I usually cover it now to keep moisture in and to melt the mozzarella, but try both ways, it’s subjective.
21. FOCACCIA: brush the surface with oil, sprinkle salt on top (rosemary if you like it)
22. Use a spatula to gently lift the pizza. When you start seeing dark marks underneath, it’s time to transfer it to a peel (or flat sheet pan) and then in the oven. Have flour on the peel and make sure the pizza slides properly in it.
23. Keep it in the oven for 30 seconds, take it out, turn it 180 degrees, put it back in for 30 seconds.

This heavily draws from [The Combo Method by Gigio Attanasio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGYadIZmloA). I rise the dough in a different way, but the cooking method is his. He has great suggestions on how to stretch the dough with, guess what, a bowl (at 1:46).

His recipe involves rising the dough for 18 hours in the fridge and 5 hours outside. That is the RIGHT way to do it. If you want to try that, you will have to put the individual balls in the fridge (in containers) and take them out long before you want to cook them.
